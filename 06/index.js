Challenge:
1. Write JavaScript to create a snowflake and make it fall inside the snow globe. The snowflake should have a random starting position, animation duration, and size.
2. See index.css
*/
}

setInterval(createSnowflake, 100); // Let's create a snowflake every 100 milliseconds!

/* Stretch goals:
- Give some variety to your snowflakes, so they are not all the same. Perhaps every 25th one could be a snowman ☃️?
- Remove each snowflake after a set time - this will stop the scene from being lost in a blizzard!
- Add a button that makes the snow start falling, it could trigger a CSS-animated shake of the snow globe. Then make the snow become less frequent until it slowly stops - until the button is pressed again.
- Change the direction of the snowflakes so they don’t all fall vertically.
- Make the style your own!
