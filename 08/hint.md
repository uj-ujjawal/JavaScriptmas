If you are stuck getting started or short of time, there is some starter code in starter.js. This will give you the initial state for the game. But remember: there are multiple ways you could code this game!

As well as the code in starter.js you will likely need two functions:

1. A function to check each guess. This function should decide if the guessed letter exists in the word. If it does, the letter should be displayed, if not, a snowman part should disappear. (Splitting the word into an array and using the includes method could be useful here ðŸ˜‰)

2. A function to check if the game is over. If the game is over, this function should render the appropriate message, and, in the case of a win, reinstate all removed snowman parts and render the sunglasses. Again, the .includes method could be useful here!
