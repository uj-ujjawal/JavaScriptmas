/*
The run up to Christmas is quite a data-intensive time for Santa. In order to understand market trends, Santa's Data Elves have collated sample children‚Äôs wish list data from 4 locations and now need to know which was the most popular toy requested overall. This will help with procurement for next year.

**Task**
- Your task is to find the most requested toy from the array of objects ‚ÄútoysRequested‚Äù. But remember: some toys appear in more than one location!

Expected output: "The most popular toy is üé≤ board games with 9000 requests.""

**Stretch Goal**
- Complete this challenge using the .flatMap() method to work with the various "toys" arrays.

console.log(`The most popular toy is <TOY> with <NUMBER> requests.`);
